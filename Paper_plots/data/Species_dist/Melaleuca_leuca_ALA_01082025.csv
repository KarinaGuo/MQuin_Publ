The leaf was photographed using light transmitted through the leaf. We normally see light reflecting off leaves, so the colour palette would look different, mostly darker shades of colour. With transmitted light if we crop the image, more light would be transmitted though the leaf for any given area, giving a different colour palette again. This is the colour palette for this image, rather than being representative for all leaves of this species.The ten most dominate colours in the leaf are listed on the left. The source image was in 8bit colour with an sRGB colour profile embedded.It is a visual colour palette of the main colours in the leaf, it is not scientifically exact.Colour names based the hexadecimal RGB colour code: https://www.99colors.net/color-names Source image attached.","","","","69f7e6d8-1b09-4ea4-ae4e-213038c11758","","","","","43bd41a5-41dd-435d-ab5b-3b0153ea9e78","","","2018-12-29T20:13:21Z","07:13 AM","363","363","2018","12","29","","","","","","","","","77aba24d-db38-47d9-ab17-be128df97444","","","","","","","Australia","AU","New South Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","nullnull","-28.849","153.598975","EPSG:4326","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/apni/2913904","Melaleuca leucadendra","Melaleuca leucadendra","","","","","","","","Plantae","Charophyta","Equisetopsida","Myrtales","Myrtaceae","Melaleuca","","","","species","","(L.)
